## Mint Classics Inventory Analysis

### Project Overview
Mint Classics Company, a retailer specializing in classic model cars and other vehicles, is considering closing one of its storage facilities. To assist in making an informed data-driven decision, this project aims to provide suggestions and recommendations for inventory reorganization or reduction while maintaining timely service to customers.

### Project Objectives
1. Inventory Exploration: Analyze the current inventory by examining data, locations, and item-related information.
2. Identify Key Factors: Determine essential factors that influence inventory reorganization and reduction decisions.
3. Data-Driven Recommendations: Formulate data-driven suggestions and recommendations for inventory optimization, which may include closing one of the storage facilities.

### Questions
1. Where are items stored and if they were rearranged, could a warehouse be eliminated?
2. How are inventory numbers related to sales figures? Do the inventory counts seem appropriate for each item?
3. Are we storing items that are not moving? Are any items candidates for being dropped from the product line?

### Key findings
- The South warehouse had the lowest stock among all the warehouses.
- The East warehouse had the highest stock out of all the warehouses.
- The South warehouse had the least sales among all the warehouses.
- The East warehouse had the most sales out of all the warehouses.
