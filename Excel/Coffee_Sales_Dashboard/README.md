## Thank you for your interest in my work.

In the Coffee_Sales_Dashboard project, I've taken a deep dive into the world of data analysis using Excel. I've employed various Excel functions and features to clean and analyze data effectively.

One of the highlights of this project is the use of powerful Excel functions such as XLOOKUP, INDEX, MATCH, and Pivot Tables. These functions have allowed me to efficiently process and transform data, creating meaningful insights.

Moreover, I've put special emphasis on creating an interactive and informative dashboard. This dashboard allows users to explore data dynamically by adjusting the timeline, roast type, size, and coffee type. It provides a visual representation of totals over time, offering a clear and insightful overview of the data. This project showcases my skills in data cleaning, advanced Excel functions, and the development of user-friendly dashboards to make data more accessible and actionable.
